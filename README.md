# OpenAI Assistant Interaction
The goal of this program was to implement OpenAI with API key(s) to allow for AI responses. The program implements to usuage of pyttsx3 to also allow for text-to-speech for the response, making the functionality of the progrma multi-modal (both written and audible).
The program should allow for the following:
- Exception for OpenAI, API Key, and enviorment errors.
- Allow the user to exit the program.
- Basic prompt and response feedback through both speech and text.

This program was created by me, Noah Sizemore, with assistance from the sources below.
## Sources
- OpenAI response instructions were provided by HayGen (link in code).
- GitHub OpenAI API library assisted in implementing OpenAI API.
